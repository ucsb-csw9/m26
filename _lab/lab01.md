In this lab, you'll have the opportunity to practice:

* Defining classes in Python
* Defining methods in Python classes

**Note:** In general, it is always important to work on labs and reading early so you can gain the proper context and utilize our office hours to seek assistance / ask clarifying questions during the week before the deadline if needed!

It is a good idea to read up on some tools we'll use in this lab before you get started, specifically String Formatting and Object Oriented Programming.

The main idea for this lab is to write a program that will organize grocery items into a grocery store. The program should have the basic ability to add / remove / search for groceries.

# Instructions

You will need to create two files:
* `Item.py` - file containing a class definition for a grocery item object.
* `Store.py` - file containing a class definition for an grocery store object.

There will be no starter code for this assignment, but rather the class descriptions and required methods are defined in the specification below.

It's recommended that you organize your lab work in its own directory. This way all files for a lab are located in a single folder. Also, this will be easy to import various files into your code using the `import / from` technique shown in lecture.

## `Item.py` class

The `Item.py` file will contain the definition of what a grocery item is.

We will define the grocery item attributes as follows:

* `upc` - `int` that represents the grocery item's 12-digit Universal Product Code.
* `category` - `str` that represents the category of a grocery item such as produce, health, beverage, etc. <b>Your program should ensure that this field will be stored in all upper-case characters</b>.
* `name` - `str` that represents the name of a grocery item. <b>Your program should ensure that this field will be stored in all upper-case characters</b>.
* `price` - `float` that represents the price of the item.

You will write a constructor that allows the user to construct a grocery item object by passing in values for all of the fields. <b>Your constructor should set these attributes with the value `None` by default</b>.

* `__init__(self, upc, category, name, price)`

In addition to your constructor, your class definition should also support "setter" methods that can update the state of the grocery item objects:

* `setUpc(self, upc)`
* `setCategory(self, category)`
* `setName(self, name)`
* `setPrice(self, price)`

Note that `category` and `name` parameters can contain upper / lower case characters, but your program should ensure these values are stored in upper-case.

Each grocery item object should be able to call a method `toString` that you will implement, which returns a `str` with all the grocery item attributes. The string should contain all attributes in the following EXACT format:

```python
i = Item(420012347654, "produce", "avocado", 2.0)
print(i.toString())
```

<b>Output:</b>

```
UPC: 420012347654, Category: PRODUCE, Name: AVOCADO, Price: $2.00
```

<b>Note:</b> The `i.toString()` return value in the example above does not contain a newline character (`\n`) at the end.

<b>Tip:</b> Note that the price is displayed with two decimal places (as traditionally used when displaying prices). Consider using the string's `format` method (or `f-string`) where the floating point value will contain 2 decimal places. For example:

```
>>> price = 1.5
>>> "{:.2f}".format(price)
'1.50'
```

## Store.py

The `Store.py` file will contain the definition of what a single grocery store object is.

A `Store` object will contain a dictionary structure where the keys of the dictionary will be a `str` representing an Item's category (all upper-case characters).

The dictionary values will be a list of Item objects that the Store contains. Note that the order of the Items in the list is based on when the Item object was inserted into the dictionary structure (most recent Item inserted will be at the end of the list).

Your code should support the following constructor / methods:

* `__init__(self)` - Constructor that initialized the dictionary structure of the Store class. Initially, this dictionary should be empty.
* `addItem(self, item)` - Adds an Item object (`item`) to the Store. The inserted Item object should be added to the end of the list of existing items that have the same category. You may assume that an item with the same UPC does not already exist in the Store when this method is called (the tests will not attempt to insert duplicate items, and you do not need to check for these cases). It is possible for an Item object to have `None` values as its attributes.
* `removeItem(self, item)` - Removes an Item object (`item`) from the Store if it exists. Your code will need to check and see if the parameter item object has the same `upc` value as an existing item in the Store if it is to be removed from the Store.
* `removeCategory(self, category)` - removes all Items of a certain category from the Store if it exists. Your code will need to remove the entire category entry from the Store's dictionary.
* `getItems(self, category)` - Returns a string containing all Items of a certain category. This string should consist of a collection of strings - one line per item. <b>Since each item will be in its own line within a single string, a newline character (`\n`) should be inserted between each line (if applicable) EXCEPT at the very last line where no newline character should exist</b>. The order of the Items in this string will be dictated by the order of the Items in the Store's list for the Item's category. The Item `toString()` method should be used when constructing this method's return string. If no Items of the category exists in the Store, then this method returns an empty string (`""`). Note: the `category` parameter value may be in either lower / upper case.
* `doesItemExist(self, item)` - Returns True if the parameter `item` (with matching `upc` value) exists in the Store. Returns False otherwise.
* `countDollarItems(self)` - Returns an `int` representing the number of items that are less than or equal to 1 dollar.

**Important Note:** Gradescope tests are dependent and mixed with each other. For example, in order for the `getItems` method to work correctly, your `addItem` method will need to work correctly since Gradescope is using your `addItem` functionality before checking if `getItems` is correct. In order for the `addItem` to work, `doesItemExist` method will need to work correctly since Gradescope is using `doesItemExist` to make sure Item objects are stored correctly in the dictionary. Therefore, if some of your tests do not pass, the problem could be in a different method than what Gradesope is testing. We'll talk about how we can write our own tests soon to modularly confirm pieces of our code are working correctly. But for now, try and think of various situations to ensure each piece is working as expected according to the specifications.

## Submission

Once you're done with writing your class definition, submit your `Item.py`, and `Store.py` files to the `Lab01` assignment on Gradescope. There will be various unit tests Gradescope will run to ensure your code is working correctly based on the specifications given in this lab.

If the tests don't pass, you may get some error message that may or may not be obvious at this point. Don't worry - if the tests didn't pass, take a minute to think about what may have caused the error. Double-check all of your functionality since Gradescope tests depend on the correct functionality of all your methods. If you're still not sure why you're getting the error, feel free to ask your TAs or Learning Assistants - we're here and happy to help during our office hours and lab sections!
